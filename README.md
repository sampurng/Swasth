## Aim

Swasth is a health and fitness application using an Oracle database involves designing a robust database schema, defining tables, establishing relationships, and ensuring data integrity and security. The project's goal is to create an all-inclusive exercise and health application. Individual data, body composition, sleep habits, exercise regimens, and overall health measures can all be tracked by users. Based on the data gathered, the application will offer insights on things like health condition, workout performance, and sleep quality. For female users, it might also include functions like menstrual monitoring. The application will allow users to log in with their credentials and access the features based on their role (admin or regular user). Regular users can view and update their personal details, monitor body composition, track sleep patterns, and record exercise activities. Admins, in addition to regular user features, can manage users, add new users and persons, and perform advanced searches based on unique identifiers. The user data will be securely stored and managed, ensuring privacy and data integrity. Overall, the goal is to provide a user-friendly and efficient platform for users to monitor and improve their health and fitness.
